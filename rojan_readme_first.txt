hi pls don't freak out.

2 things:

for the order to make more sense see the files in the order of date modified (oldest comes first). it'll make more sense (except for discretisation and geometry I modified them again). "view.png" should help.

It should work something like this order:
 -io
 -geometry
 -discretisation
 -boundaries
 -physics
 -solver

The model/physics folder is the most important. That's where neither of us alone would have enough time to read all the source material.
